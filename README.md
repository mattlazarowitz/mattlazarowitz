- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattlazarowitz

When I created this account, I intended to share various things I've created. 
What has actually happened are that projects get started by stagnate or I get them to a rough level of functionality to only see an alternative implementation that I decide to persue. 

So instead what I hope to convey are two things.
The first is that I continue to persue software engineering and programing for myself, try to learn new skills, and fill in skills gaps.
The second is to help provide something for others trying to learn to see as an example even if the shining light is self immolation :)

You can check out my processional background in my repository mattlazarowitz/matt_lazarowitz_cv too. 
The most interesting jobs I've had have been working with datacenter tech. The most fun stuff I've created are my Arduino IOT sensors.
What I enjoy doing is creating things that are useful.
