- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattlazarowitz

I use this space to store past projects and hope that perhaps some of my work might help others. 
At present, most of what is here are Arduino projects trargeting the ESP8266 to implement IOT sensors that then use 
Node-Red to provide a dashboard and logging capabilities. 

C is my strongest language but I am trying to improve my C++ via Arduino projects.
I'm learning Javascript in the context of Node-Red which is reflected here.
I also have some experience with simple Python scripts in tools I've written. 
Most of my Python experience both personal and professional has been for data extration and organization.
